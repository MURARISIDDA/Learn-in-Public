        🌱 What is "Learn in Public"?
        <br>
“Learning in public” means sharing your learning process, progress, and insights openly with others, often on platforms like blogs, social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram), YouTube, or even forums. Instead of keeping your learning private, you:
<br>
Document what you’re learning.
<br>
Share your struggles and breakthroughs.
<br>
Reflect on what you’ve learned.
<br>
It’s the opposite of waiting until you’re an expert to share — you share while you’re learning.
<br>
<h3>🔍 Why Do People Learn in Public?</h3>
